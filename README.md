## About me

I'm Diego Sanoja, a Junior Associate of the Enterprise Data Operations and Technology (EDOT) Department at Export Development Canada who graduated with distinction from the Concordia University with good mathematical and statistical skills and completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate of Coursera in 4 months. I have proficiency with spreadsheets (Excel and Google Sheets), Microsoft Power BI Desktop, SQL (BigQuery and PostgreSQL), and the R, Python and SAS programming languages. Furthermore, I speak English, intermediate French and Spanish.

I'm a person who is a fast learner, focused, hardworking, determined and with high attention to details to do a job individually or as part of a team by following the steps of the process given. 

Answering questions, finding patterns and connections using data, and creating reports and visuals to show those insights are things that I'm passionate about.

## Portfolio Projects

This section contains the projects and case studies that I have done to develop and improve my skills in data analysis, programming languages, data visualization and BI tools.

### Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

https://github.com/diegosanoja/Google-Capstone-Project

#### Description:

This project was a case study given to me during the final period of the Google Data Analytics professional certificate of Coursera. The objective was to analyze the data of 12 different csv files from a fictional company called Cyclistic and then write a report to present the insights and conclusions obtained from the analysis.

#### Tools Used and Their Purpose:

* Microsoft Excel was used to clean the data.
* RStudio and the R programming language were used to combine the csv files, make further changes and analyze the cleaned data, create different data visuals and then generate a pdf report using RMarkdown.

#### Skills Used:

* Data Cleaning.
* Data Analysis.
* Data Visualization.
* Report Writing.
* Statistics and Mathematics.
* Statistical Analysis.
* Organizational Skills
* Problem Solving.

### Maven Market Project

https://github.com/diegosanoja/Maven-Market-Project

#### Description:

This project was an optional exercise given at the end of the 'Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence' certificate of Udemy whose objective was to use Microsoft Power BI Desktop to create an interactive dashboard using the information of 8 csv files of a fictional company called Maven Market.

#### Tools Used and Their Purpose:

* Microsoft Power BI Desktop was used to clean the data of the csv files, create a data model and then to build the interactive dashboard.
* RStudio was used to generate a report using RMarkdown.

#### Skills Used:

* Data Cleaning.
* Data Analysis.
* Data Visualization.
* Report Writing.
* Organizational Skills.
* Problem Solving.

### Citi Bike Project

https://github.com/diegosanoja/Citi-Bike-project

#### Description:

This project was a practice case study that had the purpose of analyzing a Google public data set to improve my skills in data analysis, data visualization, Google BigQuery and the Python programming language.

#### Tools Used and Their Purpose:

* BigQuery was used to write SQL queries which returned aggregate data from the original data set. Furthermore, the results were saved in Google Sheets files.
* Google Sheets was used to make some changes to the data produced by the queries and produce csv files.
* Python was used analyze the information in the csv files in a Jupyter notebook and create different visuals.
* RStudio was used to generate a pdf report using RMarkdown.

#### Skills Used:

* Data Cleaning.
* Data Analysis.
* Data Visualization.
* Report Writing.
* Organizational Skills.
* Statistical Analysis.
* Problem Solving.

### TV Shows Project

https://github.com/diegosanoja/TV-Shows-Project

#### Description:

This project was a practice case study that had the purpose of analyzing a Kaggle public data set to improve my skills in statistical data analysis, data visualization, Microsoft Power BI Desktop and the SAS programming language.

#### Tools Used and Their Purpose:

* Microsoft Excel was used to remove inconsistent data and produce csv files that were analyzed using Microsoft Power BI Desktop and SAS Studio.
* Microsoft Power BI Desktop was used to perform data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization on the original data set and to produce both a pdf which shows the visuals of the interactive dashboards created and an Excel file with the new calculated columns.
* The SAS programming language was used to perform statistical data analysis in the Excel file generated by Power BI in SAS Studio.
* Microsoft Word was used to generate 2 pdfs. The first contains the DAX expressions used to generate calculated columns and measures in Power BI. The second one contains the SAS codes written in SAS Studio used to perform statistical data analysis along with tables and other visuals produced which are relevant to the tests performed to the data set.
* RStudio was used to generate a pdf report using RMarkdown.

#### Skills Used:

* Data Cleaning.
* Data Analysis.
* Data Visualization.
* Report Writing.
* Organizational Skills.
* Statistical Analysis.
* Problem Solving.
