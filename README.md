I'm Diego Sanoja, a graduate with distinction from the Concordia University with good mathematical and statistical skills who speaks English, Spanish and French and completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in 4 months. I have proficiency with spreadsheets (Excel and Google Sheets), Microsoft Power BI Desktop, SQL (BigQuery and PostgreSQL), and the R, Python and SAS programming languages.
