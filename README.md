## Portfolio Projects

This section contains the projects and case studies that I have done to develop and improve my skills in data analysis, programming languages, data visualization and BI tools.

### Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

https://github.com/diegosanoja/Google-Capstone-Project

#### Description:

This project was a case study given to me during the final period of the Google Data Analytics professional certificate of Coursera. The objective was to analyze the data of 12 different csv files from a fictional company called Cyclistic and then write a report to present the insights and conclusions obtained from the analysis.

#### Tools Used and Their Purpose:

* Microsoft Excel was used to clean the data.
* RStudio and the R programming language were used to combine the csv files, make further changes and analyze the cleaned data, create different data visuals and then generate a pdf report using RMarkdown.

#### Skills Used:

* Data Cleaning.
* Data Analysis.
* Data Visualization.
* Report Writing.
* Statistics and Mathematics.
* Statistical Analysis.
* Problem Solving.

### Maven Market Project

### Citi Bike Project

https://github.com/diegosanoja/Citi-Bike-project

#### Description:

This project was a practice case study that had the purpose of analyzing a Google public data set to improve my skills in data analysis, data visualization, Google BigQuery and the Python programming language.

#### Tools Used and Their Purpose:

* BigQuery was used to write SQL queries which returned aggregate data from the original data set. Furthermore, the results were saved in Google Sheets files.
* Google Sheets was used to make some changes to the data produced by the queries and produce csv files.
* Python was used analyze the information in the csv files in a Jupyter notebook and create different visuals.
* RStudio was used to generate a pdf report using RMarkdown.

#### Skills Used:

* Data Cleaning.
* Data Analysis.
* Data Visualization.
* Report Writing.
